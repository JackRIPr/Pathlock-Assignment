Solution: 

The Ride-Sharing App Feature Testing task involves introducing a feature for "Scheduled Rides" and identifying key areas for testing.

The "Scheduled Rides" feature allows users to:

Book a ride up to 7 days in advance.
Set pickup location, destination, and time.
Receive notifications 30 minutes and 5 minutes before the ride.
Allow drivers to accept scheduled rides and receive reminders.
Impose a penalty for cancellations made within 30 minutes of the ride.

Key Testing Areas

1. Booking Functionality:

-Test if a user can successfully schedule a ride up to 7 days in advance.
-Verify that mandatory fields (pickup location, destination, time) are validated.
-Ensure error messages for invalid inputs, such as past dates or times beyond the 7-day limit.
-Validate time zones to ensure accurate scheduling.

2. Notification System:

-Verify notifications are sent 30 minutes and 5 minutes before the scheduled ride.
-Test notifications across different channels (e.g., SMS, email, app push notifications).
-Ensure notifications respect the user's preferences.

3. Driver Acceptance:

-Verify that drivers can view, accept, or decline scheduled rides.
-Test if reminders are sent to drivers at appropriate times.
-Ensure no duplicate assignments (e.g., one ride assigned to multiple drivers).

4. Cancellation Policy:

-Validate the penalty logic for cancellations within 30 minutes of the ride.
-Test scenarios where users cancel before 30 minutes to ensure no penalty is applied.
-Ensure the penalty fee is calculated correctly and charged appropriately.

5. Edge Cases:

-Booking rides at peak or non-working hours (e.g., midnight or holidays).
-Multiple users scheduling rides simultaneously.
-Ride re-scheduling or editing after booking.

6. System Performance:

-Test load handling for multiple scheduled rides.
-Validate that the system processes concurrent ride notifications efficiently.

7. Error Handling:

-Test for scenarios like invalid addresses, system downtime, or failed notifications.
-Verify clear and actionable error messages for users and drivers.
